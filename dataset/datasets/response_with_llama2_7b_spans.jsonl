Jordan, 37, set out to fish in the ocean from his 35-foot sailboat but was caught in a storm that capsized his boat and broke his mast. Despite being injured and unable to repair the boat, Jordan managed to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but made little progress against the currents. He was eventually rescued by the crew of a 1,000-foot container ship after signaling for help. Jordan's father, Frank, reported his son missing on January 29th, and the Coast Guard has found no reason to doubt his incredible story. Jordan is an experienced sailor, but this was his first time sailing alone. He had been living on his boat at a marina in Conway, South Carolina, and had been experiencing difficulties catching food.

To make a graph for your research, you can follow these general steps based on the provided passages:\n\n1. Collect your data: As stated in Passage 1, the first step is to collect all the data you want to represent in your graph. For example, if your goal is to compare the amount of rainfall in different months, you would need to measure and record the rainfall data for each month.\n2. Determine the type of graph: Based on the information provided in Passage 2, you can choose to make either a bar graph or a line graph. A bar graph is suitable for comparing groups or types, while a line graph is better suited for showing trends over time.\n3. Title your graph: According to Passage 2, it's important to title your graph to provide context and explain what the graph represents. Make sure to include a clear and concise title that describes the data being displayed.\n4. Find out how high your graph needs to go: As mentioned in Passage 2, you'll need to determine the height of your graph based on the data you're presenting. This will ensure that the bars or lines are proportional to the size of the categories they represent.\n5. Use appropriate scales: When making a bar graph, make sure to use appropriate scales on the x-axis (categories) and y-axis (values). This will allow the reader to easily interpret the data and understand the relationships between the categories.\n6. Proportionately size the bars: As noted in Passage 3, it's important to proportionally size the bars based on the size of the category they represent. This will create a clearer visual representation of the data and prevent any one category from dominating the graph.\n7. Add colors or labels: Depending on the type of graph you choose, you may want to add colors or labels to make it more visually appealing and easy to read.\n\nUnable to answer based on given passages.

Once the basecoat is dry, drizzle a crumpled rag or plastic bag in the glaze mixture to achieve an aged appearance.\n3. Layer stain on top of the paint to create a cool effect ( passage 1). This technique involves applying multiple layers of stain and allowing them to dry between coats.\n4. Use a palette knife to spread a mixture of molding paste and a rust or dull color on a canvas, letting it dry before adding additional layers ( passage 2). This can help create an embossed design with an antique finish.\n5. Apply a thin layer of burnt sienna or a similar color to give the wood a vintage look ( passage 3).

A transistor functions as both an amplifier and a switch.\n2. The transistor's design allows it to control a larger supply of electricity with a small amount of electricity, much like turning a valve to control a supply of water.\n3. The base of the transistor pulls electrons from the emitter, creating a flow of electricity through the transistor.\n4. The transistor can take in a tiny electric current at one end (the input current) and produce a much bigger electric current at the other end (the output current) when it works as an amplifier.\n5. The holes in the base of the transistor act as a barrier, preventing any significant current flow from the emitter to the collector when the transistor is in its off state.\n6. When the electrons and holes move across the two junctions between the n-type and p-type silicon, the transistor begins to work.\n7. The collector current is approximately beta (common-emitter current gain) times the base current, and it is typically greater than 100 for small-signal transistors but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications.\n\nUnable to answer based on the given passages.", "response_spans": [[0, 63], [65, 415], [416, 920], [921, 1159], [1161, 1206]]}

This inequality is seen as a major challenge to global justice.\n\nThe third passage distinguishes between instrumental and non-instrumental forms of egalitarianism.

However, it does not provide specific instructions for planting sprouted potatoes.\n\nPassage 3 provides more detailed instructions for planting potatoes, including turning the soil over in the planned planting area, digging a trench, and cutting the potatoes into cubes with a sprout on each cube. It recommends covering the potatoes with a layer of compost and replacing the dirt on top of the plantings.\n\nBased on these passages, here are the steps to plant a sprouted potato:\n\n1. Cut the sprouted potato into chunks with two or three eyes each, using a sharp knife.\n2. Allow the cut ends to dry out in a cool, dark location overnight.\n3. Dig a trench about 4 inches wide and 6 to 8 inches deep in the planned planting area.\n4. Place the dried-out potato chunks into the bottom of the trench, separating each chunk by about 6 to 8 inches.\n5. Cover the potatoes with a layer of compost.\n6.

Here's my answer to the question:\n\nThe weighted average method of costing inventory assigns an average cost to each piece of inventory when it is sold. When a unit of inventory is sold, the weighted average method takes the average cost of all inventories currently available and assigns that average price to the item sold. Since inventory prices fluctuate, the weighted average cost will also change.\n\nTo calculate the weighted average cost per unit, divide the cost of goods available for sale by the number of units available for sale. The weighted-average figure can then be used to assign costs to both ending inventory and cost of goods sold. The recorded amount of inventory on hand using the weighted average costing method represents a value between the oldest and newest units purchased into stock.\n\nWeighted average costing is commonly used in situations where inventory items are intermingled and it is impossible to assign a specific cost to an individual unit, or when the accounting system is not sophisticated enough to track FIFO or LIFO inventory layers.", "response_spans": [[0, 408], [410, 815], [817, 1079]]}

It was the most widely planted premium red wine grape in the world for much of the 20th century, but was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s. However, by 2015, Cabernet Sauvignon had once again become the most widely planted wine grape variety, with over 341,000 hectares (3,410 km2) under vine worldwide.", "human_response": "Cabernet Sauvignon (French: [kab\u025b\u0281n\u025b sovi\u0272\u0254\u0303]) is one of the world's most widely recognized red wine grape varieties.", "label": ["Yes"], "id": 54}
